![OWCT Logo](https://github.com/VicHofs/overwatch-competitive-tool/blob/master/.github/Banner.png)

The **Overwatch Competitive Tool (OWCT)** project is a comprehensive suite of tools designed to enhance the competitive experience, organized tournaments, and streaming in Overwatch. It aims to provide valuable resources to players of all styles, including professional players, streamers, and casual or competitive players.

## Philosophy

- **Free:** OWCT is committed to providing all its features 100% free of charge, without any ads, subscriptions, or hidden fees. We rely on donations and the support of the Overwatch community to fund the project and keep it accessible to everyone.

- **Open:** The OWCT project is open-source, allowing the Overwatch community to contribute, provide suggestions, and make requests. We value the input and demands of the community, and new tools are developed based on these contributions.

- **Aimed:** OWCT is built by players, for players. We believe in mutual benefit and aim to develop tools that make sense for everyone. All developers involved in the project must be experienced Overwatch veterans, ensuring that the tools are designed with a deep understanding of the game and its player base.

## Features

- **Team Sorter:** A tool for organized tournaments that automatically sorts players into balanced teams based on their role and rank. Users can add players manually or import player information from a file for automatic sorting.

- **Stream Overlay:** An animated overlay for streamers that displays a live reading of a selected player's rank by role or all-around. The overlay updates automatically every 30 minutes, providing real-time rank information during Overwatch streams.

## Getting Involved
