## Philosophy

- **Free:** OWCT is committed to providing all its features 100% free of charge, without any ads, subscriptions, or hidden fees. We rely on donations and the support of the Overwatch community to fund the project and keep it accessible to everyone.

- **Open:** The OWCT project is open-source, allowing the Overwatch community to contribute, provide suggestions, and make requests. We value the input and demands of the community, and new tools are developed based on these contributions.

- **Aimed:** OWCT is built by players, for players. We believe in mutual benefit and aim to develop tools that make sense for everyone. All developers involved in the project must be experienced Overwatch veterans, ensuring that the tools are designed with a deep understanding of the game and its player base.

## Features

- **Team Sorter:** A tool for organized tournaments that automatically sorts players into balanced teams based on their role and rank. Users can add players manually or import player information from a file for automatic sorting.

- **Stream Overlay:** An animated overlay for streamers that displays a live reading of a selected player's rank by role or all-around. The overlay updates automatically every 30 minutes, providing real-time rank information during Overwatch streams.

- _More coming soon!_

## Getting Involved

We welcome and encourage contributions to the Overwatch Competitive Tool (OWCT) project. Whether you'd like to help with translations, design, or code, your contributions can help improve OWCT and make it even more valuable for the Overwatch community. For all contributions other than coding, reach out to **VicHofs** on [Discord](https://discord.gg/BkjbqWBTTB) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vic_hofs). To run the project locally and contribute with code, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Begin by cloning the OWCT repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/VicHofs/overwatch-competitive-tool.git
```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory and set up:** Once the cloning process is complete, navigate to the project directory and checkout the `develop` branch using the following commands:

```sh
cd overwatch-competitive-tool
git checkout develop
```

3. **Set Up the Development Environment:** Before running the project, you need to set up the development environment. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

**yarn:**

```sh
yarn
```

**npm:**

```sh
npm install
```

4. **Create a new branch:** Create a new local branch named after your changes with the following command, replacing `BRANCH_NAME` with the name of your branch:

```sh
git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME
```

5. **Make Changes and Test:** Now you're ready to make your desired changes to the OWCT project. Whether you want to improve existing features, fix bugs, or add new functionality, feel free to make your modificationsâ€”just try to focus on one main change at a time.

6. **Commit and Push Changes:** Once you are satisfied with your changes, commit them using descriptive and concise commit messages:

```sh
git commit -m MESSAGE
git push
```

8. **Create a Pull Request:** Finally, navigate to the OWCT repository on GitHub and create a pull request (PR) to propose your changes. The PR should be from your branch to `develop`. Provide a clear and detailed description of the changes you made, along with any relevant information that can help the maintainers review your contribution.
