  "app.about.body": "The <bold>Overwatch Competitive Tool (OWCT)</bold> project was started with <strikethrough>Winston's Recall</strikethrough> the realization that while many other games (VALORANT, CS:GO, League of Legends) have several tools on the web that help competitive players gain an edge, the same could not be said for Overwatch. It aims to provide several tools that help players of all stylesâ€”from streamers and professional players to casual and competitive players. {br}{br}Currently, OWCT is being single-handedly developed by <bold>Victor Hofstetter</bold> (VicHofs), a Software Engineer but also Overwatch streamer and Collegiates player (and notorious Genji Main). However, the project is open-source and any contribution is welcome. Some examples of resources that would be well-received are translations, designs, and code. Reach out to VicHofs over <discord>Discord</discord>, <twitch>Twitch</twitch>, or <twitter>Twitter</twitter> if you'd like to contribute! {br}{br}The application is still in its early stages, so support from the community is more important than ever at this time. If you're reading this right now, it means you're already playing a part in its growth (thank you!), but if you'd like to become an active early supporter, consider <bmc>making a donation</bmc> or joining <discord>Fox Den</discord> to give feedback!",
